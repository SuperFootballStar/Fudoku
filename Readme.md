Roadmap
=======

You can get some information about our roadmap by looking at the issue page.
We're planning on resuming work on FFDoku during the Winter break, 2012.

Versions
========

The versions in Master and gh-pages are not the same.

In Master you can see a newer version with some experiments with the device's keyboard. Mouse playing isn't supported in this version.
